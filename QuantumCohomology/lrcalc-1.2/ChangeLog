CHANGE LOG


1.2:    Replaced the programs mult, skew, etc. with the single program
	lrcalc.  This will put less files in /usr/local/bin.
	Also changed directory structure of source code.


1.1.8:  Linking problems on OS X reported by Volker Braun and fixed by
	François Bissey.


1.1.7:  Added the command line program "lrcalc" that does the same as
	mult, skew, coprod, lrcoef, and lrskew.  The Fedora distribution
	should just include this program in an appropriate binary
	directory.

	Got rid of exit() call in alloc.c.  In stead longjmp() is called
	if an "out of memory" event occurs.  Any program using the
	internal lrcalc functions is responsible for first calling
	setjmp(lrcalc_panic_frame).

	Wrote salloc.c which can replace alloc.c and cleans up all memory
	if an "out of memory" event occurs.  This may be desirable for
	SAGE.

	NOTE: The Makefiles should use -DSAGE if salloc.c is used.


1.1.6:  Let lrcalc build a shared library on Cygwin


1.1.6 beta1:  Fixed segmentation fault on Open Solaris (name conflict
	with hash_insert)

        Added quantum and fusion calculations in the README and
	testsuite


1.1.6 beta:  Merged in the schubert code from schmult-1.1.5.tar.gz
        Standard automake/autoconf build system (autoconfiscation)

	Thanks to Nicolas M. Thiéry and Jean-Pierre Flori for their help
	with this release.


1.1.5:  Updated the C code so it compiles (mostly) without warnings
        on 64 bit computers.


1.1.4:  Updated the c code so it compiles with newer versions of gcc.
        Also added a "-f rows,cols" option to mult which is similar to
        the -q option, bus uses fusion product notation (large
        partitions in place of the deformation parameter "q" to obtain
        a Z-basis for the quantum ring of Gr(d,n), see section 8 of my
        paper "Quantum cohomology of Grassmannians" for details.)
        A corresponding command "fusion(rows,cols)" was added to the
        maple interface.


1.1.3:  Changed the quantum(rows,cols) function so it works with Maple 7.


1.1.2:  Changed the return type of the internal function lrcoef() to
        long long to make it possible to compute LR coefficients
        greater than 2^32.  (Thanks to Anatol Kirillov for the bug
        report.)


1.1.1:  Fixed a bug in the communication between the maple interface
	and mult.c.


1.1:    Added a "-q rows,cols" option to mult which makes it possible
	to do computations in the quantum cohomology ring of Gr(d,n)
	where d=rows and n=rows+cols.
	The maple interface has new function "quantum(rows,cols)" which
	causes tos to calculate in this ring as well.


1.0.1:	Fixed error which made the program lrcoef produce false results
        in certain cases.  (Thanks to Alexander Yong for the bug
        report.)


1.0:    First version released.
